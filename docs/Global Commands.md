  - Summary: User-triggered, context-sensitive actions
  - Related: [[executable code in Unigraph]]
  - Architecture
    - Schemas (defined in `default_packages/unigraph.home/schemas`)
      - `Command`
        - name: string
        - icon: icon_url
      - `CommandHandler`
        - command: `Command`
        - condition: `Executable:lambda` 
        - action: `Executable:client` 
    - How they work
      - Commands are intentions by the user (e.g. "open detailed view", "copy-pasting", "creating/updating/deleting items", "close tab", "find text occurrences in page" )
      - Command handlers act on a user's command if their conditions match the context (e.g. should a note handler run in an html block? probably not) 
    - Data flow
      - Commands in the db are subscribed to and cached in front-end state `'registry/uiCommands'`
      - You can run a command by calling `unigraph.dispatchCommand(name: string, params: any, context: any)`. 
        - This function will find the right handler for the command, filtering by their handler conditions and run its action.
    - In Unigraph core, commands are called from the omnibar, the context menu, shortcuts, and other UI actions.
  - How to make new commands
    - Creating a new command as part of a package (check out `default-packages/uiCommands` for examples)
      - Create a new entity of `$/schema/command` 
      - Register it in `package.json` 
      - If you'd like it to do something, you'll have to create a handler entity of `$/schema/command_handler` 
      - and register it in `package.json`
      - And create the respective action and condition as executables, registering them in `package.json` also
