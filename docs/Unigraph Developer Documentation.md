  ### Overview
  - This is a temporary documentation for users who want to build their own integrations and apps on top of Unigraph.
  - Because Unigraph is highly extensible and modular, there are many parts that are not documented here. If you find something to be missing, feel free to contribute on GitHub or discuss on Discord!
