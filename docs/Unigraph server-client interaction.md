  - An average lifecycle: websocket
    - A client connects to the server through WebSocket.
      - It should provide a `browserId`, just a string representing the unique client that the client generates.
    - If the client is using the official frontend, it will request a bunch of things to the server after the connection is established to update its cache.
      - Requesting notifications and dynamic views
      - For efficiency we should also broadcast them to the client as server cache, [[should fix]].
    - The server will broadcast its cache to the client
      - Everything that's broadcasted:
        - namespaceMap
        - schemaMap
        - uid_lease
    - Now the client can freely talk to the server for more data & api calls
    - Sometimes a client would disconnect - maybe it's a mobile app and it's being suspended, or the user closed the lid of her laptop
      - When that happens (client closed the connection), the server puts all client subscriptions into hibernation and recycles all leased uids.
      - When the client reconnects, the server will:
        - Unhibernate all subscriptions & query them right away
        - Give the client new UID leases (so not the old ones!)
