    - Before - talked with [[whyrusleeping]] about AWS pricing & unit economics
      - t3 micro should be good
    - t3 micro - configuration & usage
      - Memory is pretty tight so added 1GiB of swap
      - Using only 384 MiB for dgraph cache, but could be higher
      - Average CPU idle usage is ~5%, baseline is 10% with t3 micro
      - Storage is also pretty tight, with initial db setup + swap using 6/8 GiB of default storage
        - Luckily EBS is pretty cheap
    - Other options
      - t3 small - much better performance but is way more expensive ($10/mo with commitment)
      - t4g small - equivalent to t3 small but ARM, and cheaper ($7.5/mo with commitment)
