  Dgraph is our preferred underlying graph database written in Go. This document contains notes about how unigraph works with dgraph and some useful snippets to navigate the database.
  
  We use a custom fork of dgraph which can be founded in the github organization.
  ## Uncanonical things we're doing on dgraph
  - In our fork, we re-added the removed feature of predicate list, mostly for dynamical object support. Most data with defined schema can be accessed without it.
  ## Snippets
  
  ### Query for all objects with unigraph.id
  
  ### Create relation
  ```{
    "set": {
    "uid": "0xa4",
    "_value[": [
    {"_value": {"uid": "0x7a"}}
  ]
  }
  }```
