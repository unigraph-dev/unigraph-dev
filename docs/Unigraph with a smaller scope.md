  - The idea is to disable packages that are currently not very crucial to the core workflows, and users can re-enable them later. This allows us to be more focused on a smaller set of issues and be more productive.
    - Our initial set of users are journalists, startup founders, and (low-priority) venture capitalists.
  - Packages thinking about disabling:
    - Twitter integration [[Twitter subscriptions]]
    - Reddit integration [[Unigraph for Reddit]]
    - RSS reader [[RSS Reader]]
    - Inbox (after seperating from unigraph coreuser)
    - NLP & OpenAI API [[NLP for Unigraph]] [[OpenAI API for Unigraph]]
    - Kanban board [[Unigraph Kanban]]
  - Core packages left:
    - Calendar
    - Notes
    - Contacts
    - Todo
    - Bookmark
    - Email (without inboxing, but with focus on archiving & linking with contacts, todo, etc)
    - (Potentially extract search into a new core package?)
  - (And core services, such as executables, custom views, dynamic views, and search)
  - During this initial period, we'll put all bugs related to default-disabled packages at a lower priority.

    - Sophia uses Unigraph like she would Roam
    - 2 cool, strong use cases:
      - Doing CRM right
        - 
      - Inbox from different sources
        - emails, todos, bookmarks,
