    <ul>
        <li>Gmail/Google Calendar: 1-way sync works fine. Changes in Unigraph will not be synced to Google</li>
        <li>Reddit: everything works fine!</li>
        <li>Twitter: everything works fine! Currently working on supporting multiple twitter lists and filters. For now, you'll need to create a 
            twitter list nameed 'Subscription' (exactly) and add any accounts you want to sync to unigraph there.
